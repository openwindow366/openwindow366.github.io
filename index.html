<p>As everyone knows baseball is the second most popular game in the USA after NFL. There is a similar sport which is the second most popular game in the world. Can anyone guess which sport is that?</p>

<p>Good evening toastmaster of the day, fellow toastmasters and guests...</p>

<p>Even though cricket sport is played in a few countries, it is  the second most popular sport in the world. One of the reasons is half of the total number of fans for the sport are from the second most populated country India.  People from India are so crazy about cricket. One time, I had to take off from work to watch a world cup game. Next day when I was in office, my manager said he tried to watch the game but he was confused about the rules and how it is played. I'm sure some of you (or at least Sofia have the same confusion. </p>

<p>Today, I'm going to explain cricket rules and how it is played. It is easier to compare cricket with baseball and explain because the basic principle in both games is same - Hit &amp; Run.</p>
